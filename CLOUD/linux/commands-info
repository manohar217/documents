commands:
locate -----> sudo yum install mlocate -y
If the directory is new (mkdir file), you have to update the database: (sudo updatedb) and then run your locate command again (locate filename)

find -------> find . -name <filename>

find vs locate:
locate simply looks its database and reports the file location. find does not use a database, it traverses all the directories and their sub directories and looks for files matching the given criterion.
